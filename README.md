# OOP2 - Homework

This project is part of the **Object-Oriented Programming 2** course. It consists of two assignments:

## Space Task

The task related to the space concept does not include a specific problem description. The implementation is based on your understanding and requirements from the course.

## System Task

This task involves creating a system for managing various elements in a visual interface. The system consists of the following components:

- **Panel**: A `Label` component with a white background, using the "Serif" font of size 14. The color can be changed interactively.
- **Grass Field**: A panel with green color, used to simulate a field of grass.
- **Water Surface**: A panel with a light blue color, simulating a water surface.
- **Battery**: A component that displays the current energy and capacity. The battery can be checked to see if it is full or not.
- **Generator**: A panel showing energy production, with a power value updated based on a cycle.
- **Hydroelectric Plant**: A system displaying energy production based on water, with values influenced by nearby water surfaces.
- **Power Grid**: A component that manages energy distribution across various systems, using power and battery levels.
- **Energy System**: The main system responsible for energy management, controlling the flow of energy between panels and generating new products.

This task includes interactions via buttons and input fields, where you can add new components dynamically.

## Technologies Used

- Java

## Instructions
